# my_rustlings
My personal implementations of the rustlings challenges to learn Rust.

See https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings for the full project, and try to learn Rust as well!

## Motivation of project
This project exists and is public for multiple reasons:
- To motivate myself for completing it (everybody likes a good `git commit` and `git push`)
- To show other people that I have done this - and thus that I am aware of all these concepts on a high level
- To motivate others to do this as well.

Next to this project, I am also adding "Rust from Python" calls to some of my Advent of Code implementations (for some
reason I have chosen year 2018 for that; have a look at my adventofcode repository on Gitlab or Github). In the end, 
speeding up parts of my Python code by Rust implementations is my main goal of learning Rust, but I feel that it is 
worthwhile to learn Rust as a standalone language as well, for which this `rustlings` challenge will make sure each
topic is covered at least on a basic level.
